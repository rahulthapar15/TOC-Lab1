## ToDo
- [ ] Implement string matching using Finite Automata as given in Cormen book pg. no. 995. In the first step, you need to take pattern as an input, construct 
transition table using the algorithm.In second step,take a string as an input from user and see whether the pattern exists or not using the transition table created in first step.

- [ ] Implement Thompson NFA algorithm.
    - [x] Check Regular Expression or not.
    - [ ] Create the NFA from given regular expression 
    - [ ] Feed a String to the NFA to check whether the String is accepted or not.
   
- [ ] Simulate any one embedded system (Vending Machine, Washing Machine or Microwave)using moore or mealy machine.
