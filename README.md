## ToDo
- [ ] Implement string matching using Finite Automata as given in Cormen book pg. no. 995.
        - [x] Take pattern as an input
        - [x] Construct transition table using the algorithm
        - [ ] Take a string as an input from user and see whether the pattern exists or not using the transition table created in first step.
        - [ ] Count the number of occurences and the position of the pattern in the string

- [ ] Implement Thompson NFA algorithm.
    - [x] Check Regular Expression or not.
    - [ ] Create the NFA from given regular expression 
    - [ ] Feed a String to the NFA to check whether the String is accepted or not.
   
- [ ] Simulate any one embedded system (Vending Machine, Washing Machine or Microwave)using moore or mealy machine.
